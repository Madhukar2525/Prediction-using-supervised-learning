# Prediction-using-supervised-learning
Task - In this regression task, we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as there are only two variables (1 dependant variable and 1 independant variable). What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?
